# rover4ws-kinematics
  * Symmetric Ackermann Steering;
This repository aims at providing useful functionalities to be used to compute the Kinematics of a four wheel steering rover, which is subjected to steer lower and upper joint limits. Moreover, the package allows for multiple driving mode selection:
  * Car-Like Ackermann Steering;
  * In-Place rotation;
  * Parallel Drive;
  * Lateral Drive;
  * Inner Ackermann;
  * General Ackermann.
  * Outer Ackermann;


The kinematics is compute through ICR projection procedure.
