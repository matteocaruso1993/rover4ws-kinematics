# rover4ws-kinematics
This repository aims at providing useful functionalities to be used to compute the Kinematics of a four wheel steering rover, which is subjected to steer lower and upper joint limits. Moreover, the package allows for multiple driving mode selection:
  * Symmetric Ackermann Steering;
  * Car-Like Ackermann Steering;
  * In-Place rotation;
  * Parallel Drive;
  * Lateral Drive;
  * Inner Ackermann;
  * Outer Ackermann;
  * General Ackermann.

The kinematics is compute through ICR projection procedure.

## Setup
In order to being able to use this package, it is required to be installed as a python package. To do so, run:

``` pip install -e . ```
